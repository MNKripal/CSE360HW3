## Implementation Plans & Ground Rules

**We use a structured approach with agile practices:**

Task assignments:
- Each member of the team is responsible for working on their own user story.

Weekly meetings:
- We hold meetings twice a week to track our progress, discuss any issues, and ensure we can integrate our code.

Peer code reviews:
- All code MUST be reviewed by another team member before merging to the main branch.

Version control:
- All work is tracked with our own GitHub repository.

## Project Overview

Our project extends our previous work on a **secure, friendly, and fast login/signup system** by introducing a **question and answer system** where users can post and answer questions. This phase focuses on **efficient user interaction, usability, and security.**

## Shared Agreement on User Experience and Interface

### Functional Requirements

1. **User Question Management:**
   - Users can create and submit questions with a title and description.
   - Users can browse and search questions based on keywords.
   - Users can delete their own questions.

2. **Answering System:**
   - Users can provide answers to posted questions.
   - Users can delete their own answers.
   - Users can mark answers as "worked" to indicate effectiveness.

3. **User Roles Supported:**
   - Admin, Student, Instructor, Staff, and Reviewer.

4. **Admin Management Functions:**
   - View all registered users.
   - Modify user roles.
   - Delete user accounts.
   - Grant temporary passwords.

5. **Role Assignment:**
   - Users may have multiple roles.
   - Users must log out and log in to switch roles.

6. **Error Messaging:**
   - Clear, user-friendly messages for invalid actions.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability:**
   - Intuitive interface for easy navigation and faster loading.
   
2. **Security:**
   - SQL injection protection.
   - Data consistency and frequent backups.
   
3. **Availability:**
   - The system must be accessible at all times.

4. **Compatibility:**
   - Works on major browsers and operating systems.
   
5. **Maintainability:**
   - Modular, well-documented code.

6. **Expandability:**
   - Designed for future scalability.

## Design and Implementation Plan

### Updated Classes for TP2:

- **AskQuestion:** UI for users to submit questions.
- **BrowseQuestions:** UI for viewing and filtering questions.
- **GiveAnswer:** UI for users to provide answers.
- **QuestionView:** Displays question details and associated answers.
- **RWValidation:** Ensures only authorized users can resolve questions or mark answers as "worked."
- **QuestionResultItem:** Improves question display.

### User Stories

| No. | User Story | Operation | Purpose |
|----|------------|----------|---------|
| 1  | As a student, I can ask questions. | Create | Enables students to post questions. |
| 2  | As a student, I can browse and search questions. | Read/Search | Helps avoid duplicates. |
| 3  | As a student, I can delete my own questions/answers. | Delete | Gives users control over content. |
| 4  | As a student, I can mark an answer as resolving my question. | Update | Allows resolution marking. |
| 5  | As a student, I can refine my question. | Create | Improves question clarity. |
| 6  | As a student, I can find resolved and unresolved questions. | Search | Helps users find answers efficiently. |
| 7  | As a student, I can provide feedback on questions. | Read/Create | Improves question quality. |
